# qBitTorrent Web UI address BOT

This is dkage's excellent script of sending ip adresses over Telegram, modified to send qBitTorrent's remote address in IPv4 with the port number, so phone users can tap once and access their home server.

### Commands that should be sent as Telegram messages

```ip``` --- bot answers with it's external IP and Port


## api_key.py
A file should be created that contains three important variables.
* TOKEN (this contains the API key Token generated by BotFather on Telegram)
* ID (this holds the chat ID of the bot owner) 
* PORT (this contains the port forwarded for qBitTorrent traffic(usually 8080))
The bot only responds a command with the right output, 
after checking if the chat ID is the one listed on the api_key.py. This makes a simple
but very effective security measure.
